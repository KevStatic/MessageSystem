A minecraft plugin that allows users to message or reply to one another in game.

Commands:
/msg <Player> <Message>
/r <Message>

The plugin also makes sure if the target player is offline, then sends a prompt that the target player is offline to the sender player.

Also, makes sure the message can not be sent if the target player is the sender player.

Happy coding :)
